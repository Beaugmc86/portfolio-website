          <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.</p>
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
              <p>myFlix was a personal project built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.</p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve is to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <img src="img/mongodb-movie database.png" class="mongodb">
          <h3>Server-Side</h3>
              <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format.</p>
          <h3>Client-Side</h3>
              <p>After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and receiving responses from, the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application, developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).</p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
              <p>The myFlix full-stack project was one of my most challenging and rewarding projects featured in my portfolio. Building the back-end, front-end, learning to test endpoints, using React, and hosting the website all together was a complex process that required me to use the skills I've built up over the years in my previous career experiences. Being detail oriented, taking notes, and organized helped me to take this challenge head-on and become a more competent developer.</p>
          <h2>Duration</h2>
              <p>The development of the client-side took me quite a bit longer than the back-end with all the new tools being introduced to me. After completing the project, I felt proud about what I had created and would like to build on this foundation even further with more content for future users.</p>
